## Indroduction
When people hear “news” they often associated it to something that is uninteresting due to how it is presented. Technology throughout the years has been improving as well as the way we interact with it, but what has come to a realisation is that news still has its similarities and has not shifted in the way it presents itself. The constant repetition of images and texts has resulted into many individuals not being interested in it because of its unexciting interaction. What has been identified is the interaction of reading and looking at images, scrolling up and down and/or flipping pages.<br />
<br />
What is also recognised is that people interact more with news when it relates to something that they are specifically interested in or so are their friends. Once individuals have found a topic they want to become knowledgeable about and that they have friends and other users being interested in the same topic, they are to focus on the additional materials and want to further read on it more. In order to make users have a more interesting way to interact with news as well as be more socially interactive, it has been decided to create a website that provides both a fun way to look at news and interact with other users with common interests.

##Concept
The idea of Spinning News is a website that is to be created with engaging animations in order for users to have a fun interaction with it. The website consists of a globe that is spinning around on the screen and there are pinpoints within the globe of news around the world. Within the globe, it will indicate which areas are being read more and read less by the size and the amount of pinpoints in one location. It will allow users to recognise most read global news and interact with the news in a different manner. Users can filter what kind of news they would like to read around the world, whether it is sports, humour, politics, environment and many more. Once they recognise a pinpoint they are interested in, they are to click on the news and it will zoom into the globe of the area and give a description about the news.  Regarding with the social aspect between users, users can log in to create their own profile and chat with other users around the world that are interested in the particular news. Users are also able to follow each other to see what other users have read and discussed about. Users can communicate with each other and become friends and furthermore follow each other on the website. Upon doing so, users can see what the other users are currently following, what they have read and who they have interacted with.<br />
<br />
The aim of the project is to have users who want to know more about news and communicate with other users around the world that have common interests. By doing so, the goal for Spinning News is to have a fun, exciting, well designed interface in order for users to have the best interactions with the website, is to have users enjoy their time on the website while they further read about news, and expand their knowledge about the world through recent news and others around the world.  Furthermore users can interact with each other by communicating through chat and following each other’s profiles.<br />
<br />
Audiences for Spinning News vary as there are many different types of news and topics that will be available for users to read about.  Our main audiences that we aim to build this website around are users who are interested in fun interactive websites. Usually aged 8-26 are interested in interactive websites with different animations and different ways on how materials are presented. It is also recognised that users between these ages enjoy interacting with one another and being socially active. As Spinning News will allow users to communicate with each other through live chat and follow each other and browse through different profiles to see what news they read, we target to have users who are between these ages where they are most likely to spend a lot of time being socially active.<br />
<br />
What stands out about Spinning News is the way news is being delivered and how users interact with the news. As previously mentioned the technology has changed throughout the years but what has not shifted is the interaction users have with news. It is believed that Spinning News offers a more exciting approach to delivering news and how users interact with news and to furthermore interact with one another.<br />

##Decision Making
* Each members will pick their own tasks based on their own capability to finish the task. Group members are expected to do their best to deliver tasks on time, and should contact the group in the meeting if they anticipate being unable to do so.
* Each team member has equal responsibility to make decisions within team.
* Decisions will be made by team leader when it cannot reach a consensus.
* All team members have to accept and support when a decision is made.

###Handle poor performance
Team members are required to act and behave helpful toward all the tasks and must not be a hindrance to the team’s accomplishments. In case of a team member who has a poor performance in this project, below are the steps will be took action in order to resolve the issues:
* Team leader will first give a reminder to the underperforming member and inform the team member to do his/her bit. He/ she will receive a formal warning email which will be documented for later records.
* The rest of the group should also help the underperforming member to solve the issue which he/ she may encounter such as ability problem.
* If the member still do not perform any improvement after the first two step has executed, then tutors will be contacted for further instruction.

###Resolving Conflicts
The conflicting team members should first meet up and discuss the reason of the conflict. Both side should first brainstorm for the solutions and find the best way to solve the issue. They must then agree on the solution that they considered to be the best solution and start planning on how to execute it. If the conflicting team members have found the best method to solve the issue, the last things is to implement the solution and see the final result of this decision. Both sides are responsible on monitor the solution and make any adjustments if the solution is not quite effective or another problems have appeared.

If the conflicting team members cannot reach to an agreement to solve the issues, then the remaining team will need to vote based on their opinion in order to decide who is correct in this confliction.

If the conflicts are still cannot be solve, the issues will be brought to the attention of the tutor and course coordinator for further intervention.

##Communication
####General Communication

####Meetings
* Weekly meeting is scheduled on every Wednesday from 4pm to 6pm during contact session.
* Ensure all group members attend group meetings on time.
* Group members are expected to attend all meetings and actively participate in all project related discussions.
* The group will call for extra meetings for discussion of the project when needed.
* Meeting will be scheduled 1 week in advance to ensure all members have enough time to work out their own schedules.
* If a member is unable to attend a team meeting, they should give a 3 hours notice to the rest of the tram prior to the meeting.

####Communication Outside Meetings
* Since all the team members have and familiar with facebook, it would be the primary means of communications.

##Introduction and Summary
The aim of the project is to have users who want to know more about news and communicate with other users around the world that have common interests. By doing so, the goal for Spinning News is to have a fun, exciting, well designed interface in order for users to have the best interactions with the website, is to have users enjoy their time on the website while they further read about news, and expand their knowledge about the world through recent news and others around the world.  Furthermore users can interact with each other by communicating through chat and following each other’s profiles.

Users can filter what kind of news they would like to read around the world by either liking or disliking the post and this information will be kept on their profile in order to distribute the right information to them. The more likes and dislikes they put in, the more specific articles the application can distribute. Once clicking on a pinpoint they are interested in, they can look at the caption of the news, like or dislike it or decide to read more about the article. Choosing to read more will lead the users to an external page of the detailed article, such as the image and the article itself.

Regarding with the social aspect between users, users are to create their own profile on the application by either using their Facebook account or making their own account, the reasoning behind having a profile is to allow users communicate and follow one another without privacy concerns. The convenience of logging into their Facebook account allows data extractions such as the profile picture, name, location and other information they choose to display. Once users have created their profile and have logged in, they can choose to go onto their profile and see articles they have saved and read, as well as have a look at other users to see what they have read. Another interaction is the communication between users, there are different chat rooms available for users to enter into and discuss about many different things. Chat boxes are available specific to the article users would like to further discuss about and just a general chat box where they can converse about anything.

What stands out about Spinning News is the way news is being delivered and how users interact with the news. As previously mentioned the technology has changed throughout the years but what has not shifted is the interaction users have with news. It is believed that Spinning News offers a more exciting approach to delivering news and how users interact with news and to furthermore interact with one anothe.

Mock-up illustrations of Spinning News, Figure 1: Initial view and interaction (Login or create an account) Figure 2: Once logged in, main interaction of the application consists of the globe and filter buttons as well as user profile selections

After discussing amongst one another and finalising the idea of Spinning News and the drawn mock-ups (Figure 1 and Figure 2), the team decided to split up implementing tasks step by step. 
What was first delivered was the basic aesthetics of the application; this included the index.html and styles.css file. Once the base was implemented, the globe was then added into the application. This design included the globe having pinpoints, being spun, with a pop-up box, and being zoomed in and out as shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4. Whilst the globe was being implemented, the implementation for the Facebook login and the chat box was being included into the application separately. This was accomplished and demonstrated for the second stand-up meeting. 

<img width="736" alt="screen shot 2016-10-29 at 11 34 06 pm" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13609350/19829913/4805da58-9e30-11e6-8c70-5952f25c34b2.png">

First implementation of the globe and pin points. Figure 4 shows that it zooms in.

After receiving the feedback from the stand-up meeting, the team focused more on adding content and the back-end implementation of the application. It was decided that the additional page was required to the link “Read More”; leading users to an external page of the detailed news article and a chat box that allowed them to communicate about the particular article. A mock-up design of the additional page is shown in Figure 5. 

<img width="742" alt="screen shot 2016-10-29 at 11 36 28 pm" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13609350/19829919/93097ee2-9e30-11e6-84b6-19f1e5c8e81f.png">

Additional features have been added such as the My Profile button, categories, other users’ profiles and the user’s dashboard. Chat room is available for users to chat on the right side. Brief information of a news article is now implemented in each pinpoint.

After user testing (shown in Appendix 1), it was discovered that the buttons that allowed different categories were distracting. Users were not able to fully experience the globe and run through all the pin-points that could have been discovered. It was decided to further implement the application by enhancing the globe and removing the buttons. By removing the buttons, it came to a realisation that the application no longer filters news categories and users were not able to choose their preference of articles to read. To overcome this problem, the group decided to implement like and unlike buttons within each pop up box shown in Figure 6.  The aim of this implementation is to pull in the user’s common interests and their preference of news. This filter will work through php and pulling tags from articles relating to the users’ like or dislike , once this data is filled, specific news will be distributed according to the user’s profile and interaction with the application.

<img width="706" alt="screen shot 2016-10-30 at 1 03 35 am" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13609350/19830521/65aca480-9e3d-11e6-814c-5f49f31fb255.png">
Further implementation, removals, additional and refinements have been made. Buttons are removed; chat box is more visually appealing.

<img width="688" alt="screen shot 2016-10-30 at 1 26 10 am" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13609350/19830659/e0e99750-9e3f-11e6-84e9-16b98e04fa0d.png">

Figure 7 shows what the page should look like once user clicks on Read More on the pop up box shown on the globe. It will bring users to the detailed article and they can chat about it.
Figure 8 shows the page from My Profile, this shows what the users’ account, what they have read and the people they are following as well as followers.

###Challenges
The main challenge that the group faced was incorporating all different parts together to perform at its full functionalities. The implementation of the globe had areas within the code that caused difficulties incorporating other components such as buttons and the chat box. Eventually, the group was able to come up with a prototype finalisation representing the application’s main functionalities.
